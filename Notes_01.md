# Hackathon - Philadelphia Museum of Art

They want projects specific to this museum. Will be considered more if its not something that could be applied anywhere?

* last year was first year

* Looking forward to implementation. (Last year was shorter and more presented ideas.)

Art is an expression of the human spirit. This is the celebration of Dena Wind's spirit. She made sculptures out of 'junk'.

* Hope we will find surprising elements in the broad scope of the museums contents.

## Prompt

User your skill and creativity, and the Museum's data to build a digital game that encourages visitors to spend more time in the galleries, discover more art, and connect with each other.

* Striving not for a siloed experience, where they do it detached from everyone else in the building. Want as much as possible to foster a shared experience of the art.

## Criteria

* Innovation. Seeking groundbreaking - break out of the box

* Feasibility. Needs to be realistic. Can include things not yet in existance so long as it is plausible to pull off.

* Broad engagement.

### Schedule
* Microsoft will demonstrate HoloLens on April 12th
* IBeacons overview, and visitor experience April 19th
* Submission April 28th. Hard Deadline
